Mr. Happy
=======

A Mr Happy CLI for OSX.

This CLI requires phantomjs and watir-webdriver.

To install phantomjs, run `brew install phantomjs`. Anyone reading this should have watir-webdriver installed. But, if not, run `bundle install` from the root folder.

Note that this CLI only allows status POSTs. Access the UI to read your co-workers' statuses. They're people too, you know.
